# World_Weather_Analysis
This analysis was performed to improve the PlanMyTrip app. In this process, a weather description was added to the weather data. Also, input statements were placed for users to filter the data according to their weather preferences. This is used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Then, a travel itinerary is created from the four cities chosen by the user from the list of potential travel destinations. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route is generated between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
